**Task 1:**
The `processArray` function in `arrayManipulation.js` takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

**Task 2:**
The `formatArrayStrings` function in `arrayManipulation.js` takes two arrays as input: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number, capitalizing the entire string if the number is even and converting it to lowercase if the number is odd.

**Task 3:**
The `createUserProfiles` function in `userInfo.js` takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2 as input. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
